# Data-Analysis-Dashboard
Created a data analysis dashboard using libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, and Plotly. The dashboard can visualize and analyze datasets, showcasing insights through charts and graphs.

## Overview

This project presents an advanced and visually appealing data analytics dashboard developed using Python. Leveraging libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly, the dashboard provides a comprehensive, interactive experience for exploring and interpreting multi-dimensional datasets.

## Features

* **Modern Dark Theme** with gradient color palettes
* **Interactive KPI Gauges** for real-time business indicators
* **Dynamic Time Series Visualizations** with trend lines
* **3D Customer Landscape** showing relationships between age, income, and purchases
* **Sunburst and Treemap Charts** for categorical and regional analysis
* **Animated Race Charts** displaying category performance over time
* **Heatmaps** to highlight correlation between customer metrics
* **Conversion Funnel Analysis** for tracking user journey stages
* **Real-Time Metrics Simulator** for dashboard demonstration
* **Predictive Analytics** with revenue forecasting
* **Sentiment Analysis Simulation** with weighted scoring
* **Executive Summary Report** combining multiple views
* **AI-Powered Insights Panel** with statistical breakdowns

## Technologies Used

* **Python**
* **Pandas**, **NumPy** – Data manipulation and statistical analysis
* **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn** – Static plotting
* **Plotly (Express, Graph Objects, Subplots, Figure Factory)** – Interactive and animated visualizations
* **Datetime, Timedelta, Warnings** – Utility modules

## Dataset Overview

Synthetic datasets are generated programmatically and include:

* Daily sales data (revenue, customers, orders, conversion rates)
* Detailed customer profiles (age, income, satisfaction, loyalty)
* Product-level performance metrics
* Regional revenue distribution

## How to Run

1. Ensure all required libraries are installed:

   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn plotly
   ```

2. Run the script:

   ```bash
   python data_analysis.py
   ```

3. Visualizations will render sequentially in your browser or supported IDE viewer.

## Use Cases

* Business Intelligence Dashboards
* Marketing and Sales Analytics
* Customer Segmentation and Behavior Analysis
* Executive Reporting and Data Storytelling

## Customization

This dashboard can be easily extended by:

* Integrating real-world datasets
* Replacing simulated values with API or database connections
* Enhancing visuals or modifying themes to match branding
